# Kolibri Liquidation Pool

A liquidation pool contract where users can stake `kUSD` for use in oven liquidations and receive the profits of liquidations.

##  Functionality 

### Liquidity Providers ("LPs")

Liquidity Providers ("LPs") stake `kUSD` in the contract by calling `deposit`. In return they receive `dexterLkUSD` tokens, which entitle to them to their share of the `kUSD` in the Liquidation Pool. The deposited `kUSD` is now available to help liquidate undercollateralized Kolibri ovens.

LPs can redeem `dexterLkUSD` tokens by calling `redeem` at any time. The `dexterLkUSD` tokens are burnt and the LP receives their share of `kUSD` back from the pool. 

### Liquidations

Any user may call `liquidate` with the address of an undercollateralized Kolibri oven. Provided that there is sufficient `kUSD` to liquidate the oven, and the oven is actually undercollateralized, then the following will process will happen:
1. The Kolibri oven is liquidated
2. The liquidation pool receives `XTZ` from the liquidation. 
3. Of the received `XTZ`, a percentage (currently 1%) is sent to the user who initiated the transaction to reward them for liquidating through the pool.
4. The remaining `XTZ` is immediately converted to `kUSD` on [Dexter](https://dexter.exchange). This `kUSD` is distributed ratably to users in the liquidation pool.

## Governance

A special contract, called the `governor` can make changes to the contract. Currently, the `governor` is a two of three multisig with an eight hour timelock. 

Specifically, the following parameters are governable:
- rewardPercent: The percentage of received `XTZ` to pay the user who initiated the transaction as a reward for using the pool.
- governorAddress: The governor may rotate itself to a new address (ex. a new multisig or a DAO)

Additionally, a number of mundane plumbing parameters are also updatable in order to support upgrades in Kolibri, Dexter, and Tezos metadata standards.
- dexterPoolAddress: The address of the Dexter Liquidity Pool. Updatable in case pool in needs to be rotated.
- ovenRegistryAddress: The address of the Kolibri Oven Registry. Required to support future Kolibri protocol upgrades
- contractMetadata: Updatable to allow compliance with with emerging standards
- tokenMetada: Updateable to allow compliance with emerging standards

## Risks

### Smart Contract Risk
This token contract is unaudited. If vulnerabilities are discovered, attackers may be able to drain `kUSD` from the contract.

### Market Manipulation Attacks

The pool will blindly trade `XTZ` for `kUSD` at market rate on Dexter when the contract receives `XTZ`. Because of this, attackers may be able to manipulate exchange rates on Dexter to produce favorable trading conditions for themselves.

## Interface

# Deposit a number of tokens and receive LP tokens back.
deposit(nat numTokens)

# Redeem a number of LP tokens for underlying tokens.
redeem(nat numLpTokens)

# Update the contract's balance.
